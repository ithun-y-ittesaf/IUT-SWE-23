Based on the provided sources, here are notes on psychological development, including examples where available:

**Psychological Development Overview**

*   **Psychological development** is the study of changes in an individual's physical, cognitive, emotional, intellectual, and social capabilities throughout their life, from infancy to old age [1].
*   This is the subject matter of **developmental psychology**, which scientifically studies how and why humans grow, change, and adapt across the lifespan [1]. The field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan [1].
*   Developmental psychology examines changes across three major dimensions: **physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development** [2].

**Heredity and Environment**

*   A central question in developmental psychology is **how biological factors interact with events in the child’s environment to determine the course of development** [2].
*   Most psychologists agree that **both nature (heredity) and nurture (environment) play important roles and interact continuously to guide development** [3].
*   Newborn infants have an estimated 100 billion neurons, with connections between them developing rapidly after birth [3]. The infant brain triples in weight in the first three years [3].
*   **Brain development is heavily influenced both by genetic factors and by the stimulation or deprivation a child receives from the environment in the early years** [3].
*   Even forms of development that seem determined by innate biological timetables can be affected by environmental events [4]. **Maturation** is an innately determined sequence of growth and change that is relatively independent of external events [4].
*   However, if the uterine environment is seriously abnormal, such as due to maternal sickness, malnutrition, smoking, alcohol, or drug consumption, maturational processes can be disrupted [5].

**Examples of Heredity and Environment Interaction:**

*   **Motor development after birth** illustrates this interaction [5].
    *   In some cultures, like the Kipsigis in Kenya, parents actively teach infants to sit, stand, and walk, leading to babies reaching these milestones three to five weeks earlier than American babies [5].
    *   Ache children in Paraguay have limited locomotion experience due to their dense forest environment and begin walking almost a full year later than children in the United States or Europe [6].
*   **Speech development** is another example [6].
    *   All human infants learn to speak, but they need a certain level of neurological development [6].
    *   Children in environments with more verbal interaction tend to talk earlier [6]. For instance, children in middle-class European homes talk around age 1, while children in a remote Guatemalan village with less verbal interaction don't utter their first words until over 2 years old [6]. The environment affects the *rate* of skill acquisition, not the ultimate skill level [6].

**Stages of Development**

*   Some psychologists propose that development occurs in **discrete, qualitatively distinct stages** [7].
*   The concept of stages implies that behaviors are organized around a dominant theme, are qualitatively different between stages, and all children go through the same stages in the same order [7]. Environmental factors may speed up or slow down development, but the order does not vary [7].
*   However, **not all psychologists agree that development proceeds according to a fixed sequence of qualitatively distinct stages** [7].

**Critical or Sensitive Periods**

*   **Critical or sensitive periods** are specific times during development when certain experiences must occur for psychological development to proceed normally [8].

**Capacities of the Newborn**

*   Contrary to older ideas, newborn infants are not experiencing "buzzing, blooming confusion" [8]. They enter the world with **all sensory systems functioning and are well prepared to learn about their new environment** [8].

**Newborn Sensory Capacities:**

*   **Vision:** Newborns have poor visual acuity, limited focus, and are nearsighted [9]. They actively scan their environment and are attracted to areas of high contrast, preferring complex patterns and curved lines [9].
    *   Example: They focus on the edges of objects rather than scanning the whole object like adults [9].
    *   There is evidence of an inborn **facial preference** [10]. Newborns prefer looking at a normal face over a scrambled or blank face, and even happy faces over fearful ones [10]. However, they don't perceive faces exactly like older children and adults, and significant learning about faces happens early [10].
*   **Hearing:** Even fetuses respond to sound [11]. Newborns turn their heads towards sounds and prefer their mothers' voices and stories heard in late pregnancy [11]. They can distinguish between languages with different rhythms [11].
    *   Adults speak to young infants differently (higher pitch, different sentence contours, longer pauses), known as **babytalk or motherese**, which infants prefer over normal speech [12]. Motherese helps infants detect word boundaries [12].
    *   Infants as young as six months can discriminate between intonations indicating approval and disapproval, smiling more in response to approval intonations [12].
*   **Taste:** Infants can discriminate between tastes shortly after birth [13]. They prefer sweet liquids [13].
    *   Example: A sweet liquid elicits a relaxed expression resembling a slight smile, while a sour solution produces pursed lips and a wrinkled nose, and a bitter solution causes the mouth to open with corners turned down and the tongue stuck out [13].
*   **Smell:** Newborns can discriminate among odors [14]. They turn towards sweet smells and away from noxious ones [14].
    *   Example: Breastfed infants can distinguish their mother's milk scent from another mother's milk after a few days [14]. Bottle-fed babies show an innate preference for the odor of breast milk [14]. The ability to distinguish smells helps infants avoid noxious substances, increasing survival chances [14].

**Learning and Memory in Newborns**

*   **Learning and memory are present in newborns** [15].
    *   Example: Experiments showed babies hours old could quickly learn a rule (turn head right for tone for sweet liquid, turn left for buzzer for sweet liquid) and adapt when the rules were switched [15, 16]. This indicates they can learn cause-and-effect and adjust to changing rules [16].
*   By three months old, infants have good memories [17].
    *   Example: Infants whose limbs were attached to a mobile by a ribbon learned which limb moved the mobile and remembered it eight days later [17].
*   Infants also show preferences for heartbeat sounds, female voices, and their mother's voice [17]. They prefer stories they heard before birth even when read by a stranger [17].

**Cognitive Development in Childhood: Piaget's Stage Theory**

*   **Jean Piaget** viewed children as "inquiring scientists" who build **schemas** (theories about the world) through experimentation [18].
*   They use **assimilation** (understanding new information with existing schemas) and **accommodation** (modifying schemas to fit new information) [18].
    *   Example: A boy with a schema of firefighters being male adults in bulky uniforms might first use assimilation to believe a woman in uniform is just "playing dress-up." With more evidence, he might use accommodation to modify his schema and accept that women can be firefighters [19].
*   Piaget proposed **four qualitatively distinct stages of cognitive development** [19]:

*   **1. Sensorimotor Stage (Age 0-2)** [20]
    *   **Key Focus:** Infants explore through actions and learn about consequences [20].
    *   **Key Milestone:** Development of **object permanence**, understanding objects exist even when unseen [20].
        *   Example: Before 8 months, infants stop reaching for a toy when it's covered [20]. By ~1 year, they consistently search for objects in their last seen location [20].

*   **2. The Preoperational Stage (Ages 2–7)** [21]
    *   **Key Developments:** **Symbolic thinking** (words/objects represent ideas) [21].
        *   Example: A stick can represent a "horse" [21].
    *   **Limitations:**
        *   **Lack of Logical Operations:** Difficulty mentally reversing actions [21]. Example: Difficulty understanding that pouring liquid back into the original glass reverses the change in appearance [21].
        *   **No Conservation:** Focus on appearance over quantity [21]. Example: A child thinks spreading out checkers increases their number [22].
        *   **Egocentrism:** Struggles to see others' perspectives [21]. Example: Failing the "three-mountain task" [21].
        *   **Rigid Thinking:** Dominated by visual impressions, not logic [21].

*   **3. Concrete Operational Stage (Ages 7–11)** [22]
    *   Children develop **logical thinking** and master **conservation** [22].
    *   They can perform **mental operations** [22].
        *   Example: Ordering objects by height or weight, creating mental maps [22].
    *   **Limitation:** Abstract reasoning is still tied to concrete objects [22].

*   **4. Formal Operational Stage (Age 12+)** [22]
    *   Individuals develop **abstract and hypothetical thinking** and **scientific reasoning** [22].
    *   Example: Systematically solving problems like the pendulum experiment by considering all possibilities logically [22].

**Critiques of Piaget's Theory**

*   **Underestimated Children’s Abilities:** Modern research suggests infants grasp concepts like object permanence earlier than Piaget proposed [23].
    *   Example: 4.5-month-olds show surprise at "impossible events," suggesting an innate understanding [23].
*   **Task Demands Overlooked:** Piaget's tests often required multiple skills beyond the target ability [23].
    *   Example: Conservation tasks can be affected by how the questions are worded or perceptual cues [23].
*   **Cultural & Environmental Influences:** Schooling and cultural context affect the mastery of tasks, and not all stages are universal or age-bound [24].
*   **Implications:** Development is seen as more continuous and context-dependent than Piaget suggested, and children's competence depends on how and what we test [24].

**Alternatives to Piaget's Theory**

*   While Piaget revolutionized the field, his theory has been challenged [24]. Modern research shows children may develop skills earlier [24].
*   Three key alternative approaches are: **Information-Processing, Knowledge-Acquisition, and Sociocultural (Vygotsky)** [25].

*   **1. Information-Processing Approaches:** View cognitive development as the mastery of specific skills like memory, attention, and problem-solving [25].
    *   Some reject stages entirely, seeing development as continuous [25]. Others ("neo-Piagetians") propose **domain-specific stages** (e.g., different stages for math vs. language) [25].
        *   Example: A child might use advanced logic for math but struggle with social reasoning [25].

*   **2. Knowledge-Acquisition Approaches:** Argue that cognitive differences between children and adults stem from **knowledge** rather than stages [26].
    *   **Overlapping Waves Theory (Siegler):** Children use multiple strategies simultaneously, with efficient ones becoming dominant through experience [26].
        *   Example: In a chess study, 10-year-old experts outperformed adult amateurs in recalling chess positions, showing domain-specific knowledge is more important than age [26].

*   **3. Sociocultural Approaches (Vygotsky):** Emphasize that **learning is socially guided** [27].
    *   **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):** The difference between what a child can do alone (actual level) and what they can do with guidance (potential level) [27].
    *   **Language's Role:** **Private speech** (self-talk) helps guide problem-solving [27].
    *   **Cultural Influence:** Skills develop based on cultural practices [27].

**Theory of Mind**

*   **Theory of Mind (ToM)** is the understanding that others have unique thoughts and beliefs [28].
*   **Development:**
    *   Age 2: Grasp desires and perceptions [28].
    *   Age 3: Recognize false beliefs but focus on desires [28].
    *   Age 4+: Understand that beliefs (including false beliefs) drive actions [28].
*   **Autism Link:** Difficulty with theory of mind may explain social challenges in many autistic individuals who struggle to infer others' thoughts, beliefs, or intentions [28].
*   **"Candy Box" Experiment:** A common test for ToM [28].
    *   Example: A child predicts candy is in a box labeled "M&M's." When shown crayons are inside, they are asked what another child will think is inside. A 3-year-old says "Crayons" (lacks ToM), while a 4+ year old says "Candy" (understands false beliefs) [29]. This shows they realize beliefs drive actions [29].

**Piaget’s Stages of Moral Development**

*   Piaget suggested that **moral judgment evolves with cognitive development** [30]. He proposed four stages:
    *   **Parallel Play (~2–4 yrs):** Idiosyncratic rules during play; no shared purpose [30]. Example: Sorting marbles by color [30].
    *   **Moral Absolutism (~5–7 yrs):** Rules are sacred and unchangeable; judges actions by consequences, not intent [30]. Example: "Breaking 10 cups is worse than stealing jam" [30].
    *   **Social Conventions (~7–10 yrs):** Rules are agreements that can be modified; considers intentions [31]. Example: "He didn't mean to break the tray" [31].
    *   **Ideological Reasoning (12+ yrs):** Creates rules for novel situations based on principles [31]. Example: "Fairness matters more than tradition" [31].

**Kohlberg’s Moral Reasoning Stages**

*   Kohlberg described three levels of moral reasoning [31]:
    *   **Preconventional (Ages <10):** Focus on punishment and rewards.
        *   Stage 1: Avoid punishment ("I'll get in trouble") [31].
        *   Stage 2: Seek rewards ("She'll owe me a favor") [31].
    *   **Conventional (Ages 10–13):** Focus on social approval and law-and-order.
        *   Stage 3: Social approval ("People will think I'm good") [31].
        *   Stage 4: Law-and-order ("Rules keep society stable") [31].
    *   **Postconventional (Adolescence/Adulthood):** Focus on social contracts and universal ethics.
        *   Stage 5: Social contract ("Laws should serve justice. Laws can change if they're unfair.") [31].
        *   Stage 6: Universal ethics ("Human dignity is more important than any law.") [31].

**Personality and Social Development: Temperament**

*   **Temperament** refers to a baby’s natural personality traits (e.g., fussiness, calmness, adaptability, shyness) which appear very early [32].
*   Research shows babies are born with certain temperaments, and their behavior also shapes how parents respond [32].
    *   Example: A calm baby might make parents feel confident, while a fussy baby might make them feel frustrated [33].
*   The three main temperament types are **Easy, Difficult, and Slow-to-Warm-Up** [33, 34].
*   Early temperament (0-2 years) doesn't necessarily predict later personality, but by toddler age (2+ years), temperament starts to predict later behavior [34, 35].
    *   Example: Shy toddlers often become less aggressive teens [35].
*   **Genes play a role** (identical twins have more similar temperaments than fraternal twins), but the environment (including parenting) still matters [34, 35].
*   **"Goodness of Fit" Theory:** Healthy development depends on the alignment between a child's temperament and their environment/parenting style [35].
    *   Example: A difficult baby can become well-adjusted with patient and encouraging parenting [35].

**Early Social Behavior**

*   Babies are born social and ready to connect [36].
*   Minutes after birth, newborns can **imitate facial expressions** [36].
*   By 2 months old, babies start **smiling** at parents' faces, which is seen as evolutionary to promote parent-baby bonding [36]. Even blind babies smile at the same age, suggesting it's innate [36].
*   Babies recognize people across all cultures [36].
*   **Stranger and Separation Anxiety** are developmental phases, not signs of bad parenting [34].
    *   They appear as memory improves (around 8 months) and babies can distinguish familiar caregivers from strangers [37].
    *   As they gain independence (around age 3), anxiety typically decreases [34, 37].

**Attachment**

*   **Attachment** is a baby’s deep emotional bond with primary caregivers that provides a sense of safety and security [38].
*   Early theories focused on food as the basis for attachment, but studies show that **comfort and closeness are essential** [38].
    *   Example: In the "Strange Situation" experiment, baby monkeys spent most of their time clinging to a soft cloth "mother" for comfort, even when a wire "mother" provided food [38].
*   The **"Strange Situation" test** measures attachment styles in human babies by observing their reactions when the caregiver leaves and returns [39].
*   **Secure attachment** is fostered by responsive parenting (quickly comforting the baby, following their cues) [39].
*   **Insecure attachment** can result from inconsistent or unresponsive parenting, although the baby's temperament can also play a role [39].
    *   Example: A difficult baby's fussiness might frustrate parents, leading to less responsiveness and the baby feeling insecure, but patient parenting can help even a fussy baby develop secure attachment [39].
*   Attachment is usually stable but can change due to significant life events [40].
*   **Outcomes of Attachment:** Securely attached children tend to handle stress better, be more curious and persistent, and seek help when needed [40]. Insecurely attached children may give up easily and struggle with trust in later relationships [40].

**Understanding Self-Concept, Self-Esteem, and Gender Identity**

*   **Self-Esteem** is confidence in one's own worth or abilities [41].
*   **Gender Identity** is a person’s internal sense of their own gender [41].
*   **Gender Typing** is the process of learning and adopting behaviors, roles, and traits that society associates with a particular gender [41].

**Psychological Effects of Puberty**

*   The psychological effects of puberty are also discussed in the textbook, though details were not provided in the excerpts [41].

**Adolescent Development**

*   Adolescent development includes the development of identity, as discussed by Erikson and Marcia [42]. Details from their work were not provided in the excerpts [42].
